<h3> The Magnus Archives and Fear (Spoilers Ahead!) </h3>
<p> Due to its nature as a Horror Podcast, The Magnus Archives has to interact with one of our oldest emotions: <b><i>Fear</i></b>.</p>
<p>However, one of the most interesitng things about TMA is the manner in which fear is confronted, both by the characters and the authors.
<br> In the Universe of The Magnus Archives, fear is much more then just an emotion. The Fears are incomprehensible eldritch beings, occupying the space next to reality. From here, they cling to our fears, absorbing them like leeches. Large amounts of the story are influenced by these fears, or the people who serve them in attempt to gain their blessing (known as "Avatars", which manifests as a special power to serve their new god.
