<h5><center>These are the words spoken at the end of every episode of The Magnus Archives, but what exactly is it?<center></h5>
<h6><p>Well, The Magnus Archives, also known as TMA, is, infact, a podcast. Specifically, it is an episodic, horror-tradgedy podcast, that tells a story over its 200 episodes.Each of these episdoes range from typically 15-30 minutes in length. These episodes are told in a very interesting way: the story is told through old tape recorder playings, made by the characters in the story</p></h6>

<h8><p>The Magnus archives begins with Jonathan Sims, who has just been hired as Head Archivist of The Magnus Institute, London, by Elias Bouchard, Owner of the institute. His office is a mess, and what it is a Head Archivist does is made about as clear as what happened to the previous Head Archivist, Gertrude Robinson, who "died in the line of duty" according to Elias, whatever that means. All he knows, is he has to take, listen to and organise "statements". <br>
These "statements" wont record properly on his laptop, forcing him to use an old tape recorder from the back. All of the statements seem to be accounts of outlandish yet horrifying stories from people have spoken with the Institute. Whether its coffins that sing in the rain, people who have been inexplicably "replaced" or another book from "The Library of Jurgen Lietner", Jon and his assistants, Tim, Sasha and Martin quickly find that as they stare into the depths of the Institutes Archives, they cant shake the feeling that something is staring back...</p></h8>
