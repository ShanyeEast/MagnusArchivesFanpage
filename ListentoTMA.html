<p>While the Magnus Archives is finished, its sister show, The Magnus Protocol (TMP) has only just begun. It recently finished its first 30-episode season, with 2 more in production.</p>

<p>This story is set in a different universe from the orignal show, and follows Alice and Sam, a pair of low-level civil service workers at the underfunded Office of Incident Assessment and Response who decide to investigate the Magnus Institiute, an organisation that burned to the ground in 1999, almost 20 years ago. Together, they begin to uncover its terrifying legacy...</p>
